                    It is the most consumed type of chocolate. 
                    Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in pre-Columbian times. 
                    Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe, 
                    increasingly large amounts are consumed in China and Latin America.</p>

                    It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) 
                    before they are able to digest solid food.
                    Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system,  
                    and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. 
                    Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.</p>

                    They’re a good source of fiber, healthy fats, and plant protein.

                    One of the best ways to gain an understanding of this type of chocolate is to compare it to a different type of chocolate. 
                    Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste comparison, 
                    it has a slightly bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow. 
                    This delectable flavor of chocolate is very versatile.</p>
